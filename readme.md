# Breast Cancer Prediction & AI Assistant ðŸŽ€

This Streamlit web application provides a tool for predicting whether a breast tumor is likely benign or malignant based on clinical features. It utilizes a machine learning model (Random Forest) and integrates an AI assistant powered by Google's Gemini API to help users understand the results and answer related questions.

**Disclaimer:** This application is for educational and informational purposes ONLY. It is NOT a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always consult with a qualified healthcare provider for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health.

## Features

*   **Machine Learning Prediction:**
    *   Uses a trained Random Forest classifier on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset.
    *   Predicts if a tumor is benign or malignant based on 30 clinical input features.
    *   Displays prediction confidence scores.
*   **Explainable AI (XAI):**
    *   Highlights the top influential features from the ML model that contributed to the specific prediction.
    *   Provides a detailed explanation of the ML results generated by the Gemini API.
    *   Suggests and renders visualizations (e.g., bar chart of influential features) based on Gemini's output.
*   **Interactive AI Chatbot:**
    *   Powered by Google's Gemini API.
    *   Allows users to ask follow-up questions about their results, breast cancer in general, or next steps.
    *   Provides contextual responses based on the user's ML prediction results.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:**
    *   Clean input form for clinical features.
    *   Separate panel for interacting with the AI assistant.
*   **Educational Content:**
    *   Includes links to reputable resources for breast cancer information.

## Application Structure

The application is organized into the following Python modules:

*   `app.py`: The main Streamlit application file orchestrating the UI and workflow.
*   `model_utils.py`: Handles loading the pre-trained machine learning model, scaler, and feature names, and performs the predictions.
*   `chatbot_module.py`: Contains the `BreastCancerChatbot` class, which interacts with the Gemini API for conversational AI.
*   `gemini_explainer.py`: Uses the Gemini API to generate detailed explanations of the ML prediction results and suggest visualizations.

## Machine Learning Model

*   **Model Type:** Random Forest Classifier
*   **Dataset:** [Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)) (typically loaded via `sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer`).
*   **Features:** 30 numerical features describing characteristics of cell nuclei.
*   **Target:** Benign or Malignant.
*   **Preprocessing:** Features are scaled using `StandardScaler`.
*   **Model Files:**
    *   `breast_cancer_rfc_model.joblib`: The saved trained Random Forest model.
    *   `breast_cancer_scaler.joblib`: The saved `StandardScaler` object.

## Setup and Running Locally

**Prerequisites:**

*   Python (3.8 - 3.11 recommended)
*   `pip` (Python package installer)
*   Git (for cloning, optional if you download the code)

**1. Clone the Repository (Optional):**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder-name> # e.g., breast_cancer_streamlit_app
